# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Application
Mega Rocket is a web application designed to help gym members and trainers manage their activities, schedule classes, and handle their membership. Currently, the application is built using HTML only, and CSS and JavaScript will be implemented shortly.

Installation
To start using the Mega Rocket, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. There is no need to install any software or libraries.

Usage
Once you've opened the index.html file in your web browser, you will be taken to the home page of the Mega Rocket. You can navigate to different sections of the web application using the menu at the top of the page.

## Week 01
In order to resolve the weekly problematic, there was an emulation of the Product Discovery phase. We used FIGMA to develop the screenflow of the application.

There was no code introduced in the repository.

## Week 02
There was an introduction into Git and HTML. First codes were introduced into the repository.

I developed the Landing Page of the application only using HTML. There has not been CSS code writen on this week.

## Week 03
The objective of this week is to understand the usage of CSS.

In order to move through the weekly problematic I had to:
    - Make corrections into the html file of week 2.
    - Add styles into the landing page using CSS.
    - Make sure the landing page is similar as the one created into the figma screenflow.
